##Startup Institute's Dev RampUp Challenge##
=========

The 10-day challenge for the Startup Institute Dev RampUp

I did not have time to finish all of the questions for chapter 3. I will keep working on them until Thursday's class. I had to travel for work this past weekend.

I also got sucked into configuring Heroku and deploying a flask environment. Totally worth it...
